# 🔒 Security Checklist

## ✅ Pre-Commit Security Review

Before committing your code to GitHub, ensure you've completed all the following security measures:

### 1. Environment Variables ✅
- [ ] **Database credentials** moved to environment variables
- [ ] **No hardcoded passwords** in configuration files
- [ ] **No hardcoded usernames** in configuration files
- [ ] **No hardcoded database URLs** in configuration files

### 2. File Protection ✅
- [ ] **`.env` files** added to `.gitignore`
- [ ] **`env.example`** file created with placeholder values
- [ ] **No actual credentials** in example files
- [ ] **Sensitive files** not tracked in git

### 3. Configuration Files ✅
- [ ] **`application.yml`** uses environment variable placeholders
- [ ] **Default values** provided for non-sensitive settings
- [ ] **No secrets** in configuration files

### 4. Documentation ✅
- [ ] **Setup instructions** provided for new developers
- [ ] **Environment variable list** documented
- [ ] **Security best practices** documented
- [ ] **Troubleshooting guide** included

## 🚨 Critical Security Items

### ❌ NEVER Commit These:
- Database passwords
- API keys
- Private keys
- Access tokens
- Connection strings with credentials
- Personal information
- Production URLs

### ✅ Safe to Commit:
- Configuration templates
- Example files with placeholders
- Documentation
- Code files
- Test data (without real credentials)

## 🔍 Verification Steps

### 1. Check Git Status
```bash
git status
```
Ensure no `.env` files are staged for commit.

### 2. Check Git Log
```bash
git log --oneline
```
Verify no previous commits contain sensitive information.

### 3. Search for Sensitive Data
```bash
# Search for common password patterns
grep -r "password.*=" src/
grep -r "DATABASE_PASSWORD" src/

# Search for hardcoded credentials
grep -r "postgres" src/
grep -r "314159" src/
```

### 4. Test Environment Loading
```bash
# Start the application
mvn spring-boot:run

# Check console output for:
# ✅ Environment configuration validated successfully
# ✅ Database URL: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/student_processor
# ✅ Database User: postgres
# ✅ Database Password: ***SET***
```

## 🛡️ Additional Security Measures

### 1. Database Security
- [ ] Use strong, unique passwords
- [ ] Limit database user permissions
- [ ] Enable SSL connections in production
- [ ] Regular password rotation

### 2. Application Security
- [ ] Enable HTTPS in production
- [ ] Implement proper authentication
- [ ] Use secure session management
- [ ] Regular security updates

### 3. Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Secure server configurations
- [ ] Firewall rules
- [ ] Regular backups
- [ ] Monitoring and logging

## 📞 Security Contacts

If you discover any security issues:

1. **DO NOT** create public issues
2. **DO NOT** commit fixes with sensitive data
3. **Contact** the project maintainer privately
4. **Follow** responsible disclosure practices

## 🔄 Regular Security Review

Perform this checklist:
- [ ] Before each commit
- [ ] Before each release
- [ ] Monthly security audits
- [ ] After adding new dependencies
